# Norn v3 launch state

Observed 2026-10-05 21:45 UTC. This is the single current handoff for the
pragmatic deployment objective. The [milestone contract](execution-milestones.md)
defines the exit criteria; percentages below are engineering estimates, not
owner sign-offs. Recheck external state before any new mutation.

## Current decision

**Norn v3 is not deployed on Fleet.** The Mini runs v3 source through the v3 API,
but its development profile and preserved applications do not qualify the Fleet
or complete the release. Fleet remains the first launch track. The next Fleet
attempt requires a new bounded pilot approval, fresh credentials, a repaired
partial-apply/recovery lane, and a complete workload and failure proof. Do not
reuse `pilot261004b` state, runner, keys or approvals.

At 21:29 UTC, Norn PR [#123](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn/pull/123)
merged to protected `master` as `1ca28934034c48f28aed4b97b6d4971d69b642e3`.
Norn CI [37376169196](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn/actions/runs/37376169196),
Repository CI [37376169212](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn/actions/runs/37376169212),
and docs deployment [37376169180](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn/actions/runs/37376169180)
all succeeded on that exact SHA. The Norn observer/status controller is now in
protected master; this is not a published platform release or live Fleet
deployment.

At 21:34 UTC, Fleet PR [#258](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/pull/258)
merged as `e4756190670aa3a8afa6d3cfdc6344a531dd4376`. The staging doctor now
accepts the verified GitHub squash-commit identity. It still reports three
missing input groups. `staging-plan` is missing `ADMIN_CIDRS_JSON`,
`DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`, and `STATE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `STATE_BUCKET`,
`STATE_ENDPOINT`, `STATE_REGION`, and `STATE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. `staging` is
missing `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`, `NORN_API_URL`, and the same five state-store
values. The protected runner configuration is missing
`NORN_FLEET_BOOTSTRAP_VARS_FILE`, `NORN_FLEET_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE`,
`NORN_FLEET_PRIVATE_INTERFACE`, `NORN_FLEET_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`, and
`NORN_FLEET_SSH_USER`. No provider operation has been run from staging.

The protected `platform-release` environment's
`NORN_RELEASE_IMMUTABILITY_CHECK_TOKEN` is expired. GitHub token settings show
the fine-grained token “Norn release immutability check” as expired; the
environment secret was last updated 2026-09-29. No release workflow was
dispatched. Renew the token and update that environment secret before publishing
the exact merged Norn SHA; do not substitute an unrelated token.

The most recent authenticated Mini inventory at 21:13 UTC reports source
`26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f`
(`v2.20.0-platform-72-g26147c39`), host `ok`, Fleet unconfigured with zero
pools, and production readiness blocked. Its evidence is at
`/var/folders/c8/d4bdjwzn2qgfmg3hqz7qj7ch0000gn/T/norn-inventory-20261005T211312Z`.
The merged Norn SHA has not been released or promoted to Mini.

At 19:34 UTC, a fresh authenticated Mini inventory again reported host status
`ok`, but `fleet_configured=false`, zero node pools, and production readiness
`blocked`. It found 28 apps, 45 services, zero active operations, and 25 active
incidents. The detailed safe inventory is at
`/tmp/norn-inventory-20261005T1934Z`; this confirms the Mini is online on its
v3 API source but does not establish Fleet deployment readiness.

At 20:01 UTC, a new authenticated read-only Mini inventory again reported
source commit `26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f`
(`v2.20.0-platform-72-g26147c39`), host status `ok`, Fleet
`configured=false` with zero node pools, and production readiness `blocked`.
It observed 28 app entries, 45 service entries, zero active operations, and
25 incidents. Local observation files are at
`/var/folders/c8/d4bdjwzn2qgfmg3hqz7qj7ch0000gn/T/norn-inventory-20261005T200109Z`.
This confirms the Mini v3 API is online; it does not show a Fleet deployment.

At 20:30 UTC, a fresh authenticated read-only inventory remained unchanged:
source `26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f`, host `ok`, Fleet
unconfigured with zero pools, and production readiness blocked (6 pass, 19
fail, 1 warn). It reported 28 app entries, 45 service entries, zero active
operations, and 25 incidents. Evidence is at
`/var/folders/c8/d4bdjwzn2qgfmg3hqz7qj7ch0000gn/T/norn-inventory-20261005T203015Z`.

At 20:11 UTC, the next authenticated read-only Mini inventory was unchanged:
source `26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f`, host `ok`, Fleet
unconfigured with zero pools, and production readiness blocked (6 pass, 19
fail, 1 warn). It again reported 28 app entries, 45 services, zero active
operations, and 25 active incidents. Evidence is in
`/var/folders/c8/d4bdjwzn2qgfmg3hqz7qj7ch0000gn/T/norn-inventory-20261005T201102Z`.

At 21:01 UTC, focused local tests for the separate disposable-retirement
controller worktree passed (78 tests across the coordinator, delegation,
deadline proposal, root retirement, backend cleanup, and manifest builder).
These use injected test adapters and fixtures. The worktree still contains
uncommitted changes based on Fleet `main` `5210307`; the controller has no real
executor/Spaces adapters, fresh deadline-time fence approval producer or
renewal, or restart supervisor. Its runbook still classifies deadline
retirement as not implemented and unrehearsed. This work was independent of the
Norn observer-controller integration and remains a prerequisite to safely
running another billable disposable Fleet pilot.

At 17:42 UTC, Fleet PR #256 merged to `main` as `5210307`. Merged-main plan
`37350374522` and contract validation `37350374566` both succeeded. The change
binds resumable paired backend cleanup to the exact locked run and adds a
validation-only deadline descriptor checker. It does not implement or qualify
an unattended deadline controller. Fleet PR #255 remains merged at `abb0b00`;
its merged-main validation (`37336272528`) and planning (`37336272298`) passed.
Preceding commit `1fcaeb7` passed
contract validation run `37343349906`, including the full Python unittest
suite, local retirement qualification, workflow validation and OpenTofu checks.
Commit `abaabc4` clarifies retirement CLI help text; validation run
`37344577776` passed the same contract suite at 17:01 UTC. Commit `d4eee3e`
adds a regression test proving an already-started backend cleanup can resume
after its short approval expires, while a new cleanup cannot start after expiry.
Full validation run `37346380888` passed at 17:15:58 UTC, including the full
Python unittest suite, local retirement qualification, workflow checks,
OpenTofu validation and disposable pilot validation. Review then found a race
where a replaced cleanup scope could select another run after the shared lock
was acquired. Commit `3f41503` binds the reopened scope and canonical ledger path
to the locked run; its focused regression test and full validation run
`37347927438` passed. PR #256 also
corrects the disposable README's stale `pilot261004b`
label to the actual `pilot261005a` budget-gate ID, adds a non-executable
descriptor checker, and makes an already-authorized backend cleanup retryable
after its approval expires. It records deadline-controller design requirements
but does not provide a scheduler or make a pilot safe to start. The Fleet
account has no
matching `pilot261005a` or `pilot261005c` droplets, databases, load balancers,
projects, VPCs, volumes, firewalls, reserved IPs, snapshots, or runner labels at
16:20 UTC; this is still not Spaces bucket-zero proof. Norn launch-state PR #120
was a documentation-only handoff and merged to protected `master` at 17:31 UTC
as `d67b8bf01346ef8e54f25e1119c7ffe532e05e1d`. Its `Repository CI` run
`37348527855` and `Norn CI` run `37348527835` both passed, including the required
API/CLI, Fleet pilot workload, OpenAPI, workflow lint, Web UI, M4 durable replica,
and release-bundle checks. These workflows had been manually disabled; both are
now active. This verifies the current Norn branch gates, not a Fleet deployment.
Fleet issuer PR #210 is conflicting
with main; lifecycle PR #175 has a failed contract check. Neither is a current
deployment gate result.

The approved `pilot261004b` window was $20 maximum, four hours active plus one
hour for teardown, ending **2026-10-05 08:30 UTC**. The protected
[apply run 37273763546](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/actions/runs/37273763546)
at Fleet `main` `ca52148d69eecd70a843938b72c2bc882a066c5d` stopped during provider
creation at 06:50:30 UTC with exit 143. The runner was online and idle after
termination; the signal sender is unproven. Norn attempt
`eb349686-c1ac-439d-b7b6-cf1fc2443d9f` was later marked abandoned after its
heartbeat expired. The remote Fleet state persisted at serial 3, lineage
`ffe289b7-a711-4ca6-b84d-7887c67f4d5c`, with five droplets, load balancer,
VPC, firewalls, project and tags. It did **not** contain either managed database,
although DigitalOcean had created both. No bootstrap, public ingress, etcd
quorum, application workload or scale proof followed. Automatic
[recovery run 37274493490](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/actions/runs/37274493490)
failed at source-run name validation; the repository recovery inventory would
also hold on the two provider-only databases. Plain apply replay was unsafe.

At 13:47 UTC, well after the teardown deadline, a fresh DigitalOcean inventory
still showed seven pilot droplets, three managed databases, the Fleet load
balancer, four firewalls, two VPCs and two projects. This was an **overrun
incident**. Exact-ID emergency deletion began after preserving private state
and provider evidence. By 13:58 UTC, fresh DigitalOcean list calls showed zero
`pilot261004b` droplets, databases, load balancers, firewalls, VPCs, projects,
tags, volumes, snapshots, reserved IPs and SSH keys. Both pilot Spaces state
buckets, every retained object version and both scoped Spaces keys were removed;
a new full-access Spaces inventory key found zero pilot buckets and was revoked.
The exact GitHub pilot runner and the staging secrets/variables created for
this pilot were removed. DNS A lookup for
`pilot-pilot261004b.betabung.com` returned no address. These are technical
absence observations after **emergency unprotected cleanup**, not a signed
protected final-zero receipt. The final pilot-specific DigitalOcean bill is not
yet available. The account's month-to-date balance cannot be attributed to
this pilot, so compliance with the $20 cap remains unproven.

## Controller and executor state

There are three distinct controller/executor workstreams; none alone proves
an autonomous bounded pilot or a live deployment:

* The Norn Fleet observer/controller implementation began on
  `feature/v3-fleet-controller` over the weekend and was integrated by PR #123
  into protected master on Oct 5. It is merged, tested in post-merge CI, and
  present in source; it derives and stores Fleet target, observation and status.
  It does not provision provider infrastructure. Release publication, Mini
  promotion and Fleet deployment remain separate gates.
* Fleet executor PR [#257](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/pull/257)
  remains a draft on `feature/fleet-controller-executor` at `64cb7b0`, based on
  Fleet main `5210307`; its contract check passed. This is separate newer work,
  not the weekend Norn observer/controller integration. The PR explicitly
  supports only the legacy PostgreSQL no-drain lifecycle, refuses v3/etcd before
  provider calls, and does not ship the Norn executor API route. It is not a v3
  deployment path and must not be installed on a v3/etcd staging root. No
  provider-backed E2E was run.
* The checkout `norn-fleet-deadline-retirement` is still on merged Fleet
  `main` commit `5210307` with uncommitted edits, not on an independent commit
  branch. Those edits add delegated owner authority/journaling at existing
  root/backend retirement boundaries and a post-create root approval producer.
  New `scripts/disposable_retirement_controller.py` provides a local-only
  persisted coordinator with injected stage adapters, separate controller
  locking, HMAC/hash-chained intents, proof checks, restart recovery hooks, and
  T0+5 breach-and-continue behavior. The full Fleet Python unittest suite
  passed at 20:06 UTC after the latest coordinator proof-validation changes:
  1,643 tests, four skipped, in 258.317 seconds. The earlier coordinator run
  had 1,641 tests, four skipped, in 278.771 seconds. This suite includes
  existing executor and fixture tests; it does not qualify a live provider
  adapter, unattended restartable orchestration, or deployment. Subsequent
  local changes now enforce the full root-zero and
  backend-cleanup receipt field sets, digest shapes, delegated run/root scope,
  independent provider-observation hashes, bucket bindings, and prior-stage
  receipt digests; 11 focused tests, `py_compile` and `git diff --check` pass.
  This is structural binding only: the coordinator still does not reopen and
  validate retained state exports, executor ledgers, or external provider
  evidence. The existing per-stage CLI executors do not yet have an adapter or
  launchd supervisor. The complete
  1,641 tests, four skipped, in 278.771 seconds on 2026-10-05. Both Fleet and
  launch-state `git diff --check` pass. It has no real
  root/backend command, approval, fence-renewal, or Spaces adapter and no CLI or
  launchd supervisor, and has not passed sleep/reboot/partial-apply rehearsal.

The three workstreams cover separate boundaries (Norn desired-state
observation, executor-host execution, and disposable-pilot retirement). They
need an explicit integration/release path; do not infer they compose safely
because their local tests pass.

After merged Fleet PR #256, a separate local Fleet checkout
`norn-fleet-deadline-retirement` on branch
`codex/executable-deadline-controller` contains new, unmerged work. The
`scripts/disposable_retirement_delegation.py` module validates an owner-HMAC
run delegation and maintains an owner-only hash-chained retirement journal.
The journal records and fsyncs a T0+5 breach marker before later cleanup can
continue. Both the root executor and paired-backend `apply` now have opt-in
delegation checks at their existing shared-lock mutation boundaries, with
account, budget, activation, source, evidence, lock, state/root, provider-scope,
and ordering bindings. New `disposable_deadline_approval.py` and manifest
builder support derive a short-lived HMAC approval from the owner delegation
and fresh post-create root output, state, provider scope, retention, fence
approval digest, and MySQL receipt. The root executor verifies that approval
against the exact signed delegation. Focused tests after these edits pass: 8
manifest-builder, 26 root-retirement, 19 backend-cleanup, 11 delegation/journal,
  and two deadline-proposal tests. The earlier Python suite passed 1,632 tests
  with four skipped in 300.372 seconds at 19:14 UTC, before the coordinator
  module was added. The subsequent full run including the coordinator also
  passed: 1,641 tests with four skipped in 278.771 seconds. A refreshed Mini
  inventory at 19:34 UTC again reports Fleet unconfigured and production
  readiness blocked; the controller suite pass does not alter the deployment
  gate.
  The deadline
proposal validator accepts the complete delegation CLI
bundle but remains validation-only. There is still no fully wired end-to-end
controller, fresh fence-approval producer/renewal, restart supervisor, or
sleep/reboot/partial-apply rehearsal. Do not use this branch to authorize or
start a billable pilot.

The two offline `pilot261004b` Tailscale management records (100.120.209.89
and 100.122.147.29) were removed after action-time user confirmation; the
console then showed 14 machines and no `pilot261004b` machines. The five
one-use Fleet auth keys are invalidated. The broad OAuth client that issued
them was previously revoked; a replacement scoped client was requested but
not generated. The `pilot261004b` DigitalOcean API token was revoked through
DigitalOcean’s token revocation endpoint, and a follow-up account request
returned HTTP 401. Its local token file was removed after a hash-only receipt
was saved. Technical external cleanup is now observed, but the final pilot
bill and a signed protected final-zero receipt remain unavailable.

**Reusable DigitalOcean capability:** The authenticated `doctl` context and
DigitalOcean API can eliminate repeated dashboard sign-ins for supported
account, resource, and token-management operations. An already-issued pilot
personal access token can revoke itself through DigitalOcean’s API, so cleanup
of that token does not require a second dashboard sign-in when its local token
file is still available. For `pilot261004b`, `POST` to DigitalOcean’s
[OAuth revocation endpoint](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/oauth/)
with that token as both Bearer authorization and the `token` form parameter
returned HTTP 200; a subsequent `/v2/account` call with the same token returned
401. This can eliminate a dashboard sign-in specifically for revoking an
existing token; it does not create a token, restore expired access, or prove
provider resources are gone. Record only a hash and response statuses, then
remove the local file. DigitalOcean documents the endpoint for OAuth tokens;
support for a dashboard-issued personal access token is a live observation to
recheck before relying on it in another pilot.

At 17:12 UTC, the signed-in local `doctl` default context authenticated
successfully (a fresh `doctl account get`) to
the intended `theartificial@hotmail.com` account (UUID
`05fe610a42b6d50c65344dd87bd842ce35ab036d`). Supported DigitalOcean API
inspection and operations can use this existing CLI session without a new
dashboard sign-in, including later token revocation when the active CLI context
has the required account authority. It does not supply fresh run-scoped
credentials or approval, and `doctl` cannot enumerate Spaces buckets in this
workflow; retain the separate Spaces API/S3 inventory for that proof. Read-only CLI checks found no
`pilot261005a` name matches among droplets, databases, load balancers, projects,
or VPCs. At 17:44 UTC, corrected read-only `doctl` name checks also found no
`pilot261004b`, `pilot261005a`, or `pilot261005c` matches among droplets,
databases, load balancers, firewalls, VPCs, or projects. These name checks are
not complete provider-zero evidence and did not inspect Spaces buckets. A
fresh read-only check at 18:14 UTC again authenticated to the intended account
and found no `pilot261005a` or `pilot261005c` matches in droplets, databases,
load balancers, firewalls, VPCs, or projects. This is still only a name-collision
check; volumes, snapshots, reserved IPs, SSH keys, project resources, DNS, and
Spaces buckets were not checked in this observation. No provider mutation was
made. A
plain Mini `norn fleet pools` CLI request at 17:45 returned HTTP 401
`authenticated_principal_required`; the documented owner-host SOPS inventory
path then authenticated successfully at 17:50. It confirmed Fleet
`configured=false`, zero node pools and zero plans. No Fleet plan or provider
mutation was made in this turn.

**Operational follow-up:** Use the authenticated `doctl` context first for
supported DigitalOcean account, resource, and token operations. This avoids
re-entering the dashboard for routine API-capable tasks and may allow a known
active token to be revoked through the API during cleanup. Use the dashboard
only for actions that require interactive UI authentication or are not exposed
by the API. Before a future pilot, verify the selected context/account and
required scopes with a read-only request; this convenience does not replace a
fresh run-scoped credential, bounded approval, or a separate Spaces inventory.

## Mini and source

On 2026-10-05 at 17:50 UTC, a fresh authenticated owner-host inventory showed
the Mini loopback API healthy on source `26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f`,
displayed as `v2.20.0-platform-72-g26147c39`. The platform version label's
source includes v3 work. Authenticated production-readiness returned
**blocked**: 6 of 26 checks
passed, 19 failed, and 1 warned. Current failures include the development
profile and compatibility auth, single-member Nomad/Consul, disabled ACLs and
incomplete TLS, local control database without PITR/replica, application
deployment provenance, snapshot/restore posture, and missing recovery drills.
The host status is `ok`; this does not override production readiness.

At 19:15 UTC, authenticated owner-host inventory was repeated using the
Norn-platform inventory script. It again reported healthy Mini API source
`26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f` (`v2.20.0-platform-72-g26147c39`),
host status `ok`, Fleet `configured=false`, zero node pools, zero plans, and
production readiness **blocked** with 6 pass, 19 fail, and 1 warn. It observed
28 app entries, 45 service entries (18 passing, 27 unknown), zero active
operations, and 25 active incidents. Snapshot-retention warnings remain for
field-harbor and turnkey-offer-intake; mail-mcp and signal-sideband still need
secret attention. This read-only inventory made no provider or control-plane
mutation. The local observation files are in
`/var/folders/c8/d4bdjwzn2qgfmg3hqz7qj7ch0000gn/T/norn-inventory-20261005T191507Z`.

At 20:38 UTC, a new authenticated owner-host inventory again found source
`26147c39a554b73b6761a371edee5a9591c81d3f`, host status `ok`, Fleet
`configured=false` with zero pools, zero active operations, 25 active incidents,
and production readiness **blocked** at 6 pass, 19 fail, and 1 warn. It listed
28 app entries and 45 services. The snapshot is in
`/var/folders/c8/d4bdjwzn2qgfmg3hqz7qj7ch0000gn/T/norn-inventory-20261005T203815Z`.

The authenticated `doctl` context still resolves to the intended DigitalOcean
account. Fresh read-only name-filtered lists found no `pilot261004b`,
`pilot261005a`, `pilot261005c`, `norn-staging`, or `norn-management` matches in
Droplets, managed databases, load balancers, firewalls, VPCs, volumes,
snapshots, reserved IPs, or projects. `doctl` does not inventory Spaces buckets;
this is not complete account-zero evidence. Staging Fleet's offline
`scripts/sanity.py` validation passed. Its setup doctor still reports missing
staging provider/state secrets and runner configuration. The protected squash
metadata policy is now merged and passes staging doctor. The three remaining
groups are staging-plan secrets, staging secrets and protected runner
configuration. No cloud resource was created or changed.

The exact `pilot261004b` protected apply log confirms its pre-issued public
ingress TLS check passed before provider apply. The apply then remained in
managed database creation until exit 143 at 06:50:30 UTC. The signal sender is
unproven; do not attribute this interruption to the TLS gate.

These app and service counts include discovered and inactive entries; they do
not prove identity preservation through the earlier one-way transition or
health for every app.

Norn [PR #115](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn/pull/115) merged the bridge
title correction as `c56fa0c`. The signed
[platform-c56fa0c release](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn/releases/tag/platform-c56fa0cbef322d44abf905a423bea72df26292b2)
contains four verified bundles. Publication is not Mini promotion or Fleet
fitness. The local `codex/v3-release-integration` branch remains unmerged and
must not be treated as protected release authority. The main Norn checkout has
unrelated local changes that must be preserved.

## Pilot lineage

| Pilot | Most recent useful evidence | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilot261003c` / `pilot261003d` | `c` and `d` exposed earlier gaps in provider evidence, TLS handoff and emergency cleanup. The `d` Fleet apply stopped before provider mutation; management was retired by emergency unprotected cleanup. | Historical failure evidence, not launch proof. Old `c`/`d` access items were retired in the later owner observation. |
| `pilot261004a` | Exact-SAN TLS and replacement GitHub App key supported complete management handoff and protected Fleet planning. Its apply stopped at the pre-provider retained-bucket inventory gate. Management and both backends were retired before its approved deadline. | Clean cloud/backend abort; two Tailscale device records and replacement OAuth client were still pending at the last observation. Recheck them separately. |
| `pilot261004b` | Protected plan `37273380169`, Norn plan `a25b25fa-c0b0-47e0-b9ec-836ce6cde3ed`, and apply `37273763546` reached live provider creation. State missed both databases. | Fleet never bootstrapped; emergency technical teardown occurred after the 08:30 UTC deadline. Technical access cleanup is observed; billing closure remains open. |

Pilot `a` was the first complete management-to-Fleet handoff, but `b` was the
most recent and exposed the material partial-apply failure. A fresh pilot
should be based on the repaired contracts, not resumed from `a` or `b`.

`pilot261005a` is a **proposed** fresh run ID, not an approved or active pilot.
At 16:20 UTC on 2026-10-05, read-only checks against the intended
`theartificial@hotmail.com` account found no matching droplets, databases,
projects, load balancers or VPCs; no registered GitHub runner carries its Fleet
label. The broader name checks also found no matching c-suffixed droplet,
database, project, load balancer, VPC, volume, firewall, reserved-IP or snapshot
names. These are name-collision checks, not a full provider-zero or
Spaces-bucket proof. The canonical owner-only `pilot261005a` directory, its
budget contract/activation files, and its DigitalOcean token file do not exist;
staging aggregate-budget variables still point to the retired `b` paths and
digest. Fleet [PR #255](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/pull/255)
merged the signed c budget, plan, apply, recovery and exact topology gates as
`abb0b00`; it rejects reuse of retired `pilot261004b`. The PR contract check
and merge-main plan and validation passed (`37335410031`, `37336272298`,
`37336272528`). This is code validation, not live proof. Read-only checks at
16:20 found no c-named DigitalOcean resources in the categories above and no
registered c runner. The independent deadline retirement path remains
unimplemented. Existing approvals require post-create state and expire within
an hour, so signed budget expiry alone cannot guarantee teardown. The existing
owner-Mac retire-by watchdog performs only a local finalizer; it has no
provider, GitHub, Spaces or token-exchange capability. Fleet PR #256 contains a
validation-only descriptor checker, not a controller. Its runbook records that
root destroy plans must be built after resources exist. Fleet PR #256 commit
`1fcaeb7` adds a same-lock, ledgered backend cleanup start: a retry can
continue after the short approval expires only if the first start event bound
the complete exact authority while that approval was live. Full contract
validation passed on both `1fcaeb7` and `abaabc4`. This does not authorize a
new start after expiry or provide
Fleet/management deadline-time approvals. A read-only workflow audit confirmed
no existing workflow can mint post-create retirement approvals or execute the
ordered retirement chain. There is no installed or wired
deadline-retirement executable. The separate branch's coordinator and
delegation/journal primitives alone do not close this gate. Do not start a new
billable run until a
restartable, run-scoped owner-Mac controller
can fence the runner, perform Fleet → management → backend cleanup automatically
from T0+4, retain each stage's receipts, and continue retrying through and beyond
T0+5 until final zero. A timer alone is not a hard spend cap when the owner host
or provider access is unavailable.

At 19:20 UTC, the authenticated `doctl` context again identified the intended
DigitalOcean account. Name-filtered lists contained no `pilot261004b`,
`pilot261005a`, or `pilot261005c` matches: 2 droplets, 0 managed databases,
0 load balancers, 0 firewalls, 6 VPCs, 1 volume, 2 snapshots, 0 reserved IPs,
and 3 projects were listed. This is a scoped resource-name collision check;
Spaces buckets/object versions, DNS, GitHub runners, Tailscale devices, and
provider resources without these names were not proven absent. No mutation was
made.

## Milestone estimates

No M0–M9 gate has recorded owner sign-off. These rounded estimates measure work
against each full exit criterion; they are not schedule forecasts or an overall
launch percentage. The `b` pilot adds real provider-create evidence but no
running Fleet qualification.

| Gate | Estimated complete | Finding and next proof |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| M0 baseline | 55% | Mini source and service counts observed; historical before/after identity equality and current owner baseline remain. |
| M1 control semantics | 65% | Signed v3 code runs on Mini; protected cross-process and downstream-effect recovery proof remains. |
| M2 profiles and retention | 50% | Mini uses development/PostgreSQL; separate-node restore, provider retention and legacy binding review remain. |
| M3 etcd Fleet | 45% | Local three-member rehearsals and live five-node provider creation exist; no bootstrapped etcd membership, quorum, fault/restore, alarm, rotation or soak proof. |
| M4 capacity and ingress | 40% | Local admission and two-ingress fixtures exist; no live route, placement, loaded 2→3→2 or drain proof. |
| M5 Mini upgrade rehearsal | 35% | Mini runs v3 source, but the original one-way transition lacks its before snapshot. Rehearse on a representative private current backup. |
| M6 running upgrades and app DB | 25% | Journals and local transfer fixtures exist; protected running upgrade and app DB cutover/interruption proof remain. |
| M7 mobility | 30% | Isolated Mini fixture web/worker/tick and private restore comparison passed. No Fleet target or complete move exists. |
| M8 release qualification | 30% | Post-merge release-bundle rehearsal passed; immutable release publication is held by the expired check token, and provider-backed fitness, soak/fault results and owner sign-off remain. |
| M9 adoption | 10% | Mini API runs v3 code; Fleet and controlled application adoption are absent. |

## Next actions

1. Renew `NORN_RELEASE_IMMUTABILITY_CHECK_TOKEN` and update the protected
   `platform-release` environment secret. Dispatch the immutable release
   workflow for exact SHA `1ca28934034c48f28aed4b97b6d4971d69b642e3` only after
   the renewed token is valid. Verify the signed tag, target SHA and all
   platform assets, then import and promote that release on Mini through its
   managed signed-upgrade path.
2. Supply fresh staging-only DigitalOcean/state secrets and the protected
   runner inputs listed by `scripts/setup doctor --environment staging`. The
   retired pilot's credentials and approvals are not reusable.
3. Complete and independently qualify the restartable, run-scoped retirement
   path before authorizing a new billable Fleet pilot. Require automatic Fleet,
   management and backend cleanup with preserved receipts and a final-zero
   observation within a new approved budget and time envelope.
4. Prove live Fleet state: three etcd members/quorum, Consul/Nomad enrollment,
   two ingresses and trusted public TLS, a staging workload with write/read,
   fault and restore, and loaded 2→3→2 scaling and drain. Complete the separate
   protected retirement proof for the pilot.
5. Close `pilot261004b` billing and audit with the final itemized invoice. Keep
   the emergency cleanup classified as technical cleanup; it did not produce
   a protected final-zero receipt.

## Evidence locations

- Owner-only `pilot261004b` handoff, raw Fleet and management state snapshots,
  two complete pre-cleanup inventories, run logs and exact-ID deletion records:
  `/Users/arti/.config/norn/fleet-next-full-e2e/successor-pilot261004b/fleet-protected-handoff/`.
- Protected [Fleet apply](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/actions/runs/37273763546)
  and [automatic recovery](https://github.com/antiartificial/norn-fleet/actions/runs/37274493490).
- Exact dry-run incident planner and tests in isolated Fleet checkout
  `/Users/arti/.config/norn/fleet-next-full-e2e/worktrees/incident-fleet-orphan-cleanup`
  at `eb7db92e5cb7f136472c5f43c2c4a8e5c9d4bed0`. It was not the executor
  used for the later emergency teardown and does not provide protected proof.
- `pilot261004a` abort and backend receipts under
  `/Users/arti/.config/norn/fleet-next-full-e2e/successor-pilot261004b/` and
  older pilot evidence under `/Users/arti/.config/norn/fleet-next-full-e2e/`.

The final invoice remains independent of the current technical zero
observation. The emergency cleanup did not produce a protected final-zero
receipt.
